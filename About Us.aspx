            Since 1980, Aroma Cafe has been operating as a family business. At Aroma Cafe, coffee beans are roasted
       everyday to ensure that every cup of coffee retains its unique aroma and taste. Aroma Cafe will 
       give you the experience of exploring the art of coffee. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Aroma Cafe has been, in addition, active in community. Every month, there is a donation program
        organised in the cafe. The objective of the program is to help the poor and orphans.
